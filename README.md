OOP Assignment

Description

Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! 🏗️

1.Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).

2.Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!

3.Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.

4.Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.


Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! 🎭

Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (like move()). However, make each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving" 🚗, while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ✈️).
